Analyze the speaker's attitude in the following transcript.
Transcript:
"{transcript}"

Session Context (if available, use for nuanced understanding):
{json.dumps(session_context) if session_context else "No additional session context provided."}

Based on the transcript and context, provide your analysis as a JSON object matching the SpeakerAttitude model fields below:
1.  dominant_attitude (str): Describe the dominant attitude of the speaker (e.g., "Cooperative", "Hostile", "Dismissive", "Supportive", "Neutral", "Anxious").
2.  attitude_scores (Dict[str, float]): Provide scores (0.0 to 1.0) for various relevant attitudes you can infer. Examples: {{"polite": 0.8, "impatient": 0.6, "friendly": 0.7}}.
3.  respect_level (str): Assess the qualitative level of respect shown by the speaker (e.g., "Respectful", "Disrespectful", "Neutral", "Condescending").
4.  respect_level_score (float, 0.0 to 1.0): A numerical score for the assessed respect level. 0.0 means very disrespectful, 1.0 means very respectful.
5.  respect_level_score_analysis (str): Provide a detailed analysis and reasoning for the 'respect_level_score'. Explain which cues (verbal, tonal if inferable from text) led to this score. Cite examples.
6.  formality_score (float, 0.0 to 1.0): Assess the formality of the speaker's language. 0.0 is very informal, 1.0 is very formal.
7.  formality_assessment (str): Provide a qualitative assessment of the speaker's formality. Explain your reasoning, citing examples of word choice, phrasing, or sentence structure.
8.  politeness_score (float, 0.0 to 1.0): Assess the politeness level of the speaker. 0.0 is very impolite, 1.0 is very polite.
9.  politeness_assessment (str): Provide a qualitative assessment of the speaker's politeness. Explain your reasoning, citing examples of polite/impolite markers, requests, or responses.

JSON structure to be returned:
{{
  "dominant_attitude": "...",
  "attitude_scores": {{"attitude1": score1, "attitude2": score2}},
  "respect_level": "...",
  "respect_level_score": float,
  "respect_level_score_analysis": "...",
  "formality_score": float,
  "formality_assessment": "...",
  "politeness_score": float,
  "politeness_assessment": "..."
}}
If a field cannot be determined or is not applicable, use a sensible default (e.g., "Neutral" for strings, 0.0 for floats, empty dict for scores, or "Analysis not available." for detailed analysis strings).
Focus your analysis solely on the provided transcript and session context.
