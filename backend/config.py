# Note on top_k vs return_all_scores:
# In Hugging Face pipelines, if return_all_scores=True, it returns scores for all classes.
# top_k then would mean it returns all scores but perhaps limits the list to k items if k is less than total classes.
# The original main.py had `top_k=7, return_all_scores=True`. This usually means it will return all scores for the 7 classes
# if the model has more than 7 classes, or all classes if it has <= 7.
# For 'j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base', it typically has 7 emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, neutral, sadness, surprise).
# So, `return_all_scores=True` effectively does what `top_k=7` would do if the model indeed has exactly 7 classes.
# Keeping both for consistency with the original code's apparent intent.
# If the model "j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base" has exactly 7 labels,
# then `return_all_scores=True` is sufficient, and `top_k=7` is redundant but harmless.
# If it had, say, 20 labels, `top_k=7` would restrict the output to the top 7, even with `return_all_scores=True`.
# For this specific model, it outputs 7 emotions, so `return_all_scores=True` is fine.
# I'll keep `return_all_scores=True` and remove `top_k=7` for clarity as it's effectively returning all.
# Re-checking main.py: it was `top_k=None` implicitly if not set, and `return_all_scores=True` was used.
# The transformers docs say:
# top_k (:obj:`int`, `optional`, defaults to 1): The number of top labels that will be returned by the pipeline.
# If the provided number is `None`, the number of labels is determined by the model's configuration.
# return_all_scores (:obj:`bool`, `optional`, defaults to :obj:`False`): Whether or not to return all scores of all labels.
# The original code in main.py had:
# emotion_classifier = pipeline("text-classification", model="j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base", top_k=7, return_all_scores=True)
# This is slightly confusing. If return_all_scores is True, top_k is usually ignored or means something else.
# For clarity and standard usage, typically you use one or the other.
# Given the model has 7 emotions, `return_all_scores=True` will return all 7.
# Let's stick to what was in main.py for now.
