# Session Insights Service Documentation (`session_insights_service.py`)

This document provides an overview of the `SessionInsightsGenerator` class from `backend/services/session_insights_service.py`. This class is designed to generate higher-level insights about a communication session by analyzing trends, consistency, and dynamics across multiple interaction segments.

## Class: `SessionInsightsGenerator`

### Overall Purpose
The `SessionInsightsGenerator` provides meta-analysis of a session. Instead of performing primary analysis (like transcription or emotion detection), it takes the results of such analyses over time (session history) along with the current analysis and session context to derive insights about consistency, behavioral evolution, risk trajectory, and conversation dynamics. It does not directly interface with DSPy modules but processes data that other services (which might use DSPy) would produce.

### `__init__(self)`

#### Purpose
The constructor for `SessionInsightsGenerator`.

#### Initialization
*   The `__init__` method is currently a simple `pass`. It does not initialize any specific services or configurations, as it's designed to work with data passed into its methods.

### `generate_session_insights(self, session_context: Dict[str, Any], current_analysis: Dict[str, Any], session_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]) -> Dict[str, str]`

#### Purpose
This is the main public method to generate a collection of insights about the ongoing session. It orchestrates calls to various private methods, each focusing on a different aspect of session-level analysis.

#### Input Parameters
*   **`session_context: Dict[str, Any]`**:
    *   A dictionary containing contextual information about the session. Expected keys include:
        *   `"previous_analyses"` (int): Count of previous analysis segments in the session.
        *   `"session_duration"` (float): Current total duration of the session in minutes.
        *   `"recent_transcripts"` (List[str]): A list of recent transcripts from the session.
*   **`current_analysis: Dict[str, Any]`**:
    *   A dictionary containing the results of the most recent analysis performed on the latest segment of the conversation. Expected keys include:
        *   `"credibility_score"` (float)
        *   `"emotion_analysis"` (List[Dict]): Containing `{"label": str}`
        *   `"linguistic_analysis"` (Dict): Containing metrics like `speech_rate_wpm`, `hesitation_count`, `formality_score`.
        *   `"risk_assessment"` (Dict): Containing `{"overall_risk": str}`.
        *   `"red_flags_per_speaker"` (Dict): e.g., `{"Speaker 1": List}`.
        *   `"transcript"` (str).
*   **`session_history: List[Dict[str, Any]]`**:
    *   A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a past analysis segment from the current session. Each entry is expected to have an `"analysis"` key containing metrics similar to `current_analysis`.

#### Return Value
*   **`Dict[str, str]`**:
    *   A dictionary where keys are insight categories (e.g., `"consistency_analysis"`, `"behavioral_evolution"`) and values are descriptive strings summarizing the findings for that category.
    *   Returns an empty dictionary if it's the first analysis in the session (i.e., `session_context.get("previous_analyses", 0) == 0`).

#### Key Operations
1.  **Initial Check**: If `previous_analyses` is 0, returns an empty dictionary (no insights for the very first analysis).
2.  **Orchestration**: Calls private methods to generate specific insights:
    *   `_analyze_consistency()`
    *   `_analyze_behavioral_evolution()`
    *   `_analyze_risk_trajectory()`
    *   `_analyze_conversation_dynamics()`
3.  Aggregates the string outputs from these methods into the returned dictionary.

### Private Helper Methods

The class uses several private methods to generate specific insights. These methods typically compare current analysis data with historical data to identify trends and patterns.

#### `_analyze_consistency(self, session_context: Dict, current_analysis: Dict, session_history: List[Dict]) -> str`
*   **Purpose**: Analyzes consistency in credibility scores and emotional states across the session.
*   **Key Logic**:
    *   Collects credibility scores from `session_history` and `current_analysis`.
    *   Calculates variance, mean, and trend of credibility scores.
    *   Collects dominant emotions from history and current analysis to assess emotional variability.
    *   Generates a descriptive string based on consistency level (High, Moderate, Low based on variance), credibility trend, and emotional consistency.
*   Returns "Initial analysis..." if insufficient data (less than 2 data points for scores).

#### `_analyze_behavioral_evolution(self, session_context: Dict, current_analysis: Dict, session_history: List[Dict]) -> str`
*   **Purpose**: Analyzes how behavioral patterns (speech rate, hesitation, formality) have evolved.
*   **Key Logic**:
    *   Uses `current_analysis` for current linguistic metrics (`speech_rate_wpm`, `hesitation_count`, `formality_score`).
    *   (Note: The code for extracting historical speech rates, hesitations, and formality scores from `session_history` is currently missing/commented out with a `pass` statement. The logic primarily describes current state in context of session duration and analysis count).
    *   Factors in `session_duration` and `analysis_count` from `session_context`.
    *   Generates a descriptive string commenting on formality, comfort level (based on hesitation), and speech pace.

#### `_analyze_risk_trajectory(self, session_context: Dict, current_analysis: Dict, session_history: List[Dict]) -> str`
*   **Purpose**: Analyzes the progression of risk levels and deception indicators.
*   **Key Logic**:
    *   Collects risk levels (e.g., "low", "medium", "high") and counts of deception flags from history and current analysis.
    *   Converts qualitative risk levels to numerical values (1, 2, 3) for trend calculation.
    *   Calculates trends for both risk values and deception flag counts using `_calculate_trend()`.
    *   Generates a descriptive string indicating whether the risk trajectory is "ESCALATING", "DECREASING", or "STABLE", and comments on the trend of deception indicators and the current risk assessment.
*   Returns an initial assessment if insufficient data (less than 2 risk values).

#### `_analyze_conversation_dynamics(self, session_context: Dict, current_analysis: Dict, session_history: List[Dict]) -> str`
*   **Purpose**: Analyzes overall conversation flow, pace, and engagement patterns.
*   **Key Logic**:
    *   Uses `analysis_count` and `session_duration` to assess conversation pace (analyses per minute).
    *   Calculates average response length using `recent_transcripts` from `session_context` and the `current_transcript`.
    *   Generates a descriptive string based on conversation pace, detail level (from average response length), engagement pattern (based on variance in response lengths if available), and overall session progression.

#### `_calculate_trend(self, values: List[float]) -> float`
*   **Purpose**: A utility function to calculate a simple linear trend (slope) in a list of numerical values.
*   **Key Logic**:
    *   Uses the formula for the slope of a simple linear regression.
    *   Returns 0 if there are fewer than 2 values or if the denominator in the slope calculation is zero.

**Global Instance:**
A global instance `session_insights_generator = SessionInsightsGenerator()` is created, making it readily available for import and use.
