# DSPyAudioAnalysisAnalyzer Module Documentation

## Purpose

The `DSPyAudioAnalysisAnalyzer` module is designed to infer characteristics of the audio source based **solely on the textual content of a conversation transcript**. It does not process actual audio files. Instead, it analyzes the text for cues that might suggest aspects of the original audio, such as speech clarity, background noise levels, speech rate, the presence of pauses or filler words, intonation patterns, and an overall inferred audio quality.

**Note:** This module performs its analysis based on the provided transcript text only. It does not have access to or process any actual audio data.

## AudioAnalysisSignature

The `DSPyAudioAnalysisAnalyzer` relies on the `AudioAnalysisSignature` to define its input and output fields. This signature guides the Language Model (LM) on what textual information to process and what inferred audio characteristics to report.

### Input Fields

The signature defines the following input fields:

*   **`transcript`**:
    *   **Type**: `str`
    *   **Description**: This field accepts the full conversation transcript. The module will analyze this text to infer audio characteristics.
*   **`session_context`**:
    *   **Type**: `str`
    *   **Description**: This field takes an optional JSON string providing context about the session. While not typically central for text-only audio characteristic inference, it's included for consistency with other analyzers. It can be an empty string if no context is provided.

### Output Fields

The signature defines the following output fields, which the `DSPyAudioAnalysisAnalyzer` aims to populate with inferred characteristics:

*   **`speech_clarity_score`**:
    *   **Type**: `float`
    *   **Description**: An inferred score from 0.0 to 1.0 representing the likely clarity of speech in the original audio, based on textual cues (e.g., completeness of words, grammatical structure that might suggest mumbled speech if poor).
*   **`background_noise_level`**:
    *   **Type**: `str`
    *   **Description**: An inferred level of background noise (e.g., Low, Medium, High) potentially present in the original audio, as suggested by textual artifacts (e.g., mentions of noise, incomplete sentences).
*   **`speech_rate_wpm`**:
    *   **Type**: `int`
    *   **Description**: An estimated average speech rate in words per minute (WPM) that might be inferred from the pacing and density of the text.
*   **`pauses_and_fillers`**:
    *   **Type**: `str` (JSON string of a dictionary)
    *   **Description**: A JSON string representing a dictionary with estimated counts of textual pauses (e.g., ellipses, long dashes) and filler words (e.g., "um", "uh") found in the transcript, e.g., `'{"textual_pauses": 5, "um": 2}'`.
*   **`intonation_patterns`**:
    *   **Type**: `str`
    *   **Description**: A description of inferred intonation patterns (e.g., monotonous, questioning, empathetic) based on textual cues like punctuation, phrasing, and word choice.
*   **`audio_quality_assessment`**:
    *   **Type**: `str`
    *   **Description**: An overall qualitative assessment of the likely audio quality from which the transcript was derived, based on the combined textual indicators.

## Usage

The `DSPyAudioAnalysisAnalyzer` module is typically used within a service layer that handles transcript analysis. The service would:
1.  Provide the raw transcript and any optional session context.
2.  Instantiate the `DSPyAudioAnalysisAnalyzer`.
3.  Call the `forward` method of the analyzer, passing the transcript and session context.
4.  The module then uses a `dspy.ChainOfThought(AudioAnalysisSignature)` predictor to guide the LM in its text-based inference process.
5.  The `forward` method returns an `AudioAnalysis` Pydantic model. This model contains the inferred audio characteristics, with fields populated after parsing and type conversion (e.g., for floats, ints, and JSON strings to dictionaries). Fallback values (e.g., 0.0, 0, "Analysis not available", or empty dictionaries) are used if the LM output is missing or unparsable for specific fields.

## Underlying DSPy Signature: `AudioAnalysisSignature`

The `AudioAnalysisSignature` class (inheriting from `dspy.Signature`) is key to the module's operation.

*   **Purpose**: It defines the contract for the LM, specifying the input text (`transcript`, `session_context`) and the desired output fields that represent inferred audio characteristics. The signature's docstring explicitly states the goal: "Analyze the transcript to infer audio characteristics based *only* on textual content."
*   **Mechanism**: Fields are defined using `dspy.InputField` or `dspy.OutputField`, each with a `desc` attribute. These descriptions guide the LM on how to interpret the input transcript and what kind of inferences to make for each output field (e.g., estimating `speech_clarity_score` or `speech_rate_wpm` from text).
*   **Benefit**: This structured approach allows DSPy to prompt the LM effectively for this specialized text-based inference task. It aims to achieve consistent output formatting, which the module then parses into the `AudioAnalysis` Pydantic model. The clear instruction that analysis is *text-only* is crucial for setting the correct expectations for the LM.
